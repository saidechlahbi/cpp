The dream begins softly, whispering through the quiet corners of the night.
A dream can shape a thought, a memory, or a wish unspoken.
Sometimes a dream feels real enough to touch, bright enough to follow.
In every dream, there hides a truth, waiting for the light to reveal it.
A simple dream can build worlds or destroy walls within the heart.
People chase a dream, lose a dream, then find another dream to hold.
Even when broken, the dream remains, echoing in the mindâ€™s quiet places.
The dream grows with every hope, every step, every heartbeat.
No one can steal a dream that truly belongs to the soul.
So live the dream, breathe the dream, and never let the dream fade away.
